# ideas

A place to list ideas for products including micro and nano products. Taken from [IdeaList](https://github.com/doraithodla/ideas/wiki)

If you are interested in a specific idea, please raise an issue and we will describe it in detail.

Welcome to the ideas wiki! Utterly random and may not make sense at this point. Also, these ideas are not in any specific order. I am digging up stuff that I wrote up while reading/listening to articles, books and having conversations. Some of them may be old or even antiquated. I just want to list them here and regurgitate a bit.
